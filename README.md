Skits: A World of Warcraft Addon for Immersive Conversation

Step into a more immersive World of Warcraft experience with Skits, an addon designed to bring a fresh, cinematic flair to in-game conversations. Inspired by skit-like dialogues in JRPGs, this addon transforms chat messages into an engaging sequence of talking heads, adding depth and storytelling to every interaction.

Key Features:

Immersive Skit Format: Chat messages are displayed as dynamic, skit-style dialogues, complete with character portraits and a smooth sequence of talking heads.
Storybook Log: Revisit past conversations with a storybook-like interface. Use /skitslog to relive your favorite skits anytime!
Roleplayer-Friendly: Works with player messages, making it perfect for roleplaying scenarios. Add an extra layer of immersion to your stories and interactions.
Fully Customizable: Tailor the experience to your liking. Decide which chat messages become skits, toggle talking heads or speaker portraits, and configure when skits appear—whether during combat, in dungeons, or other specific situations.
Skits isn’t just an addon—it’s a tool to enhance immersion and bring storytelling to life. Whether you're a roleplayer, a fan of JRPG-style dialogue, or simply looking for a unique way to interact with the world around you, Skits has something special to offer.

## Recommendations

Have the CreatureDisplayDB addon installed. This will vastly improve the experience with this addon.

## Limitations

### NPC Portraits

Getting the potratis for the speakers is no easy task and most of the time guess work.
Sometimes the addon will not be able to find the portrait or find the wrong one (mainly for NPCs with many different appearances).
This is something I will always be improving over time.

Having the CreatureDisplayDB addon installed vastly improves the user experience, as the portrait can be retrieve from a database and not only from the player surrondings.

### Player Portraits

Same limitations as NPC Portraits, plus we can't have a database for player portraits.
So on Skits the player portrait can be shown as the current player model. But on the skits log (`/skitslog`) it will be an aproximation of that player (race/bodytype).

## Known Issues

- Limitations listed above.
- Portraits of NPCs in some areas sometimes displays a different model. This needs to be solved in a case by case basis.

## Roadmap

No fixed roadmap yet, but I plan to keep improving this addon as much as I can.
I have plans to improve the skits art, adding more style options.
If you wanna help me develop this addon let me know.
