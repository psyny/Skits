Skits: A World of Warcraft Addon for Immersive Conversation

Step into a more immersive World of Warcraft experience with Skits, an addon designed to bring a fresh, cinematic flair to in-game conversations. Inspired by skit-like dialogues in JRPGs, this addon transforms chat messages into an engaging sequence, adding depth and storytelling to every interaction.

**Key Features:**

- **Immersive Skit Format:** Chat messages are displayed as dynamic, skit-style dialogues, complete with character portraits and a smooth sequence of talking heads.
- **Storybook Log:** Revisit past conversations with a storybook-like interface. Use /skitslog to relive your favorite skits anytime!
- **Roleplayer-Friendly:** Works with player messages, making it perfect for roleplaying scenarios. Add an extra layer of immersion to your stories and interactions.
- **Customizable:** Tailor the experience to your liking. Decide which chat messages become skits, toggle talking heads or speaker portraits, and configure when skits appearâ€”whether during combat, in dungeons, or other specific situations.

## Recommendations

Have the "Creature Display DB" addon installed. This will vastly improve the experience with this addon by increase the variety of unit models displayed.

## Important Commands

- **/SkitsLog:** Shows the conversation log.
- **/SkitsImmersive:** Toggles immersive mode on and off.
- **/SkitsToggle:** Toggle skits on and off.

## Debug Commands

- **/SkitsLocalDBStats:** shows the stats of the local database for NPC/Display ids.
- **/SkitsNPCData "npcname":** shows the current data for the given NPC name.
- **/SkitsTargetData:** show the current data for the current target.
- **/SkitsClearLocalDB:** erases the local database for NPC/Display ids. Not recommended to use without understands what this means.

## Limitations

### NPC Portraits

Getting the potratis for the speakers is no easy task and most of the time guess work.
Sometimes the addon will not be able to find the portrait or find the wrong one (mainly for NPCs with many different appearances).
This is something I will always be improving over time.

Having the "Creature Display DB" addon installed vastly improves the user experience, as the portrait can be retrieve from a database and not only from the player surrondings.

### Player Portraits

Same limitations as NPC Portraits, plus we can't have a database for player portraits.
So on Skits the player portrait can be shown as the current player model. But on the skits log (`/skitslog`) it will be an aproximation of that player (race/bodytype).

## Known Issues

- Limitations listed above.
- Portraits of NPCs in some areas sometimes displays a different model. This needs to be solved in a case by case basis.
- In rare ocasions, this addon causes a stuttering. It manifestas as a 1 to 3 seconds freeze when an NPC talks. As far as I know, this happens when having multipe skit styles selected to different situations in options. If this is happening to you, please report the skit styles you are using. The workaround is having only one skit style in use, it can be defined for different situations, but should be only one.

## Roadmap

No fixed roadmap yet, but I plan to keep improving this addon as much as I can.
If you wanna help me develop this addon let me know.
I will always be adding new Skit Styles as I find the time to do it.

## Options

Can be changed in the WoW options menu: Options -> Addons -> Skits
